## ðŸ“¦ Custom Materializers

This folder contains **custom ZenML materializers** used to properly store and retrieve artifacts produced by our pipelines.

---

### ðŸ§© Why custom materializers?

ZenML pipelines may produce artifacts of **custom Python classes** that ZenML doesn't know how to handle by default.

For example:
- `ConvAE_model_subclass`: a custom TensorFlow model class we built.

By default, ZenML uses a **Pickle materializer**:
- Only intended for quick prototyping.
- Not robust across Python versions or changes to the class.
- Not production-ready.

---

### âœ… What this materializer does

We created a custom materializer to:
- Define **how to serialize** (`save()`) and **deserialize** (`load()`) our `ConvAE_model_subclass`.
- Use TensorFlowâ€™s native model saving (`model.save()`) or a domain-specific format.
- Make artifacts:
  - Portable and robust across environments.
  - Loadable in downstream steps, serving APIs, or deployment.
